# 10. Blog/ Content Management System (Final Project, Data Driven Web Application)

In a nutshell, a culmination of everything I have learned. From using VSCode (HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX...) to JSPs/JSTL
RESTful endpoints in Java and full blown database implementation. Using Spring Security to handle page security to using 
security tags to handle rendering of pages. BootStrap was heavily utilized and TinyMCE was utilized (ableit minimally) to
allow for editing and creating of blogs and static pages. I was group lead in this project and made the most out of JIRA
and bitbucket. Tasks and sprints were utilized to manage the team. As well as constant communication over Slack!!! I believe
that this project epitomized the curriculum and allowed us to work as a group and learn from one another. Below I will throw
out other terms or technologies that were used in this project.

Miscellaneous: User Login functionality, User Roles (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER), Data manipulation methods (streams!!!), Row Mappers,
Spring Dependency injection (by bean definition), MVC, SDLC, JSON, Postman, hard work and sleepless nights!!!
